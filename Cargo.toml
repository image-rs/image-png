[features]
# Use nightly-only features for a minor performance boost in PNG decoding
unstable = ["crc32fast/nightly"]
# Use zlib-rs for faster PNG encoding at the cost of some `unsafe` code.
# WARNING: this changes the flate2 backend for your entire dependency tree!
# While the `png` crate always uses fully memory-safe decoding,
# this enables zlib-rs and introduces some unsafe code to all other crates
# that rely on flate2, including the decoding codepaths.
